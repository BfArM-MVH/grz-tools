Welcome to the documentation for `grz-cli`, a command-line tool for validating, encrypting, and uploading submissions to genome data centers (GDC) from partipating clinics as part of the [genomeDE Model Project](https://www.bundesgesundheitsministerium.de/en/en/international/european-health-policy/genomde-en/).

`grz-cli` performs the following high-level steps during a submission to a GDC:

1. Validation of submission data and metadata files.
2. Encryption with [Crypt4GH](https://crypt4gh.readthedocs.io/).
3. Upload of the encrypted submission to the GDC's S3 inbox.
